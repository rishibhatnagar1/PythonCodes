#Scraping Images 

The files in the folder are all working for now. However more testing is required, as it is said, you code will all work, until, one day, it doesn't and then you are screwed. So anyways here are the latest upates: 500px, bored panda and stevemccury are all working.
``` ```
``` ```
500px : Downloads the image from a link provided, this will be from the explore section. Click on the image to enlarge it and then put the link of the same in. You can use any name for this.
``` ```
``` ```
boredPanda: The script downloads all the .jpg files on the page. Works mostly. Needs to be tested again.
``` ```
``` ```
Steve Mc curry: I love and respect his work, wanted some inspiration, hence the script. oYou will have to go to the grid view and then put the link in.
``` ```
``` ```
